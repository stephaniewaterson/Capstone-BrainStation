# LocalLingo

## Web application for learning langauges, specifically local dialects assocatied to different regions and countries.

#### LocalLingo is a web application create for my capstone (final project) at BrainStation, London. It is designed as a CRUD application to incorporate the skills learnt on the bootcamp. 

The app was created using React fro the front end and Express for the backend/API. The API that is used by the application is in another respository found at [Capstone API](https://github.com/stephaniewaterson/Capstone-api-BrainStation) which is linked to a database in SQL. The app was built in 12 days, and so there are more additions to be added in the near future.

For the meantime Spanish is the only lanuage with links, others will be added in the near future. Blogs on Spain and Colombia are running, or feel free to add posts and comments!

### Why a language app?
I love learning languages - probably partly why I love programming! - and sometimes I've found it harder to delve deeper into different dialects or how phrases are said in specific countries. While there are many resources on the internet already, I find that I have to go to many different sites to find what I am looking for. LocalLingo I have/will design to house different areas of learning. Initally there is a post and comment blog area for people to share or post questions, a chat feature where you can live chat with people also wanting to learn/language exchange. I plan to implement a translation feauture, translating from one language to the standard language as well as the other ways of saying it. I also will add authentication to have users. I would also like a geographical feature to see where users are based and who you can potentially connect with.

### Challenges
Main challenges were deciding on what to incoporate and what to do first with time limits for V1. I have yet to encouter a larger challenge though, I assume I may do when I develop the app further. I look forward to challenging myself and overcoming these obstacles. 

## Installation 

1. download or clone the repository
2. run npm install
3. create own env file and set environments as per env.example
4. npm run dev

## Use

1. As Spanish is the only language fully functioning right now, select this option
2. Choose a country (Spain or Colombia)
3. Browse or add or comment posts, delete if wish
4. Open up the chat, coordinate with another user to choose the same country (room) and chat
